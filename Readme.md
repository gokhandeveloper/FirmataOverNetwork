I have specifically only enabled Stepper motor and basic digital input/output Firmata features to save memory to be used with the LinearDriveSystemController.

If you need extra features like analog input/output, you can enable it for your needs.
In this project, I used Arduino Yun which is now retired.
You can use a better unit like:

I would avoid using eth or wifi shields for reliability issues.
