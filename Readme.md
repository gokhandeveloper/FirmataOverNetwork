I have enabled Stepper motor Firmata feature to be used with the [LinearDriveSystemController](https://github.com/gokhandilek/LinearDriveSystemController)
.

In this project, I used Arduino Yun which is now retired.
You can use better units like:

I would avoid using eth or wifi shields for reliability issues.
